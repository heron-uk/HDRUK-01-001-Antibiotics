# Report

Code to generate the report for your project. 
Steps:
1. Open the `DED_shiny` folder, which contains the code required to make a shiny displaying the drug exposure diagnostics results. 
2. Copy your results (in .zip format) into the `data` folder.
3. Launch yor shinyApp by opening the `global.R` file and push the 'Run App' button on the top right of the pane.

If you are unable to get the shiny to work, you could try running the function `DrugExposureDiagnostics::viewResults()`, which will create a new shiny for your results using the zip file generated by the study code.
