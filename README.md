### Prerequisites

-   **R** and **RStudio** are required to run the code.
-   Ensure that you have access to the database and necessary credentials to connect.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Download the Repository**\
    Download this repository:

    -   Either download as a ZIP file using `Code -> Download ZIP`, then unzip.
    -   Or, use GitHub Desktop to clone the repository.

2.  **Open the R Project**

    -   Navigate to the `Study` folder and open the project file `Study.Rproj` in RStudio.
    -   You should see the project name in the top-right corner of your RStudio session.

3.  **Run the Analysis Code**

    -   Open the `CodeToRun.R` file. This is the main script youâ€™ll use.
    -   Follow the instructions within the file to add your database-specific information.
    -   Run the code as directed. This will generate a `Results` folder containing the outputs, including a log file, zip file with the DED results, and a csv with the study results. The name of the zip file will be of the format `DED_Results_database_name.zip`, and the name of the csv will be `results.csv`.

4.  **OPTIONAL: Visualize Results in Shiny**

    -   To visualise the DED results, navigate to the `Report` folder, then the `DED_shiny` folder, and open the project file `DrugExposureDiagnosticsShiny.Rproj` in RStudio. Copy the generated .zip file into the `data` folder. Open the `global.R` script and click the *Run App* button in RStudio to launch the local Shiny app.
    -   To visualise the study results, navigate to the `Report` folder, then the `shiny` folder, and open the project file `shiny.Rproj` in RStudio. Copy the generated `results.csv` file into the `data` folder. Open the `global.R` script and click the *Run App* button in RStudio to launch the local Shiny app.
